Hi there 👋

🎓 I am currently working as a Research Assistant in Computer Engineering.

🔬 My research interests include Machine Learning, Large Language Models (LLMs), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Embedded Systems, and Web Technologies.

📚 I focus on bridging the gap between academic research and practical software development, especially in time-series analysis, AI applications, and embedded web solutions.
