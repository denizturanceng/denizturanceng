🎓 I am currently working as a Research Assistant in Computer Engineering.

🔬 My research interests include Machine Learning, Large Language Models (LLMs), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Embedded Systems, and Web Technologies.

📚 I focus on bridging the gap between academic research and practical software development, especially in time-series analysis, AI applications, and embedded web solutions.

🌐 Besides research, I also work on full-stack web development and embedded software projects.

✍️ I am actively publishing and contributing to the academic community through conference papers, journal articles, and open-source projects.
